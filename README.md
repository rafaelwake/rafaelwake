## About myself

### Project Engineering Technician, with extensive experience in the development of OEM products, validation testing, and NPI (New Product Introduction). In 2022, I made a career transition to the field of software development, where I work with front-end and back-end in applications for home automation, IoT, and financial payment solutions. I use technologies such as JavaScript (Angular, React.js), Node.js, and Ionic, and apply agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban. Additionally, I have other skills in the product area, application of good information security practices, maintenance of mobile apps, and deployment of applications on AWS.

### This combination of experiences in engineering and software development allows me to see the product life cycle in a comprehensive way, which enhances the delivery of high-quality solutions.
